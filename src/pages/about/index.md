title: Welcome to CantPause!

This site is an archive of all my video game thoughts and opinions. I want it to be for those looking to learn and discuss the latest happenings of the video game industry. I’ll give my take on development updates, news, rumors, and of course the games themselves once they reach my hands. 

Cant Pause is not supposed to be an example of fine journalism. It’s supposed to be a fun, sometimes casual, sometimes deep, dive into the hobby I love. I'm always open for improvement though, so please email me your feedback or suggestions if you have any.

# Who Runs This Site?

My name is Joseph and I’m a Software Engineer currently living in Seattle. No surprise here, but I like video games.

I love getting into the nitty-gritty of the video games industry. I love dissecting the most exciting upcoming projects, gaming-related business decisions, and where the industry is headed as a whole.

That’s why this site exists. 

Because I have a ton of super-niche video game thoughts and don't feel like always talking someone's ear off about this one hobby I'm obsessed over.

Now instead of posting a picture of me here, I’m going to post a picture of my dog Flora because why not. Also, I want the people that skip this explanation to think a dog runs this site.

# Let's Have a Discussion!

At the end of the day, I just want to talk about video games. If you read an opinion you like (or dislike) go ahead and [tweet me about it](https://twitter.com/th3hoopman) so we can talk! If you want a more extended discussion, feel free to join [the discord](https://discord.gg/mgkfacFZxk) I run with [my podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/3oNzUYeq8gfRal3MpklVOH?si=b98d172f3c314ba6) cohost.
