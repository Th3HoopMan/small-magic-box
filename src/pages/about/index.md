title: Welcome to Can’t Pause!
---
This site is an archive of all my video game thoughts and opinions. Topics of the posts will span the entire gaming industry. I’ll discuss rumors of games, the development process, and of course the final product once it reaches my hands. 

This site is mainly for me, but it is also for those looking to learn and discuss the happenings of the video game industry. Sometimes I’ll go off script and discuss my opinions on the MCU or whatever anime I’m currently watching, but I intend for the core focus to be video games.

Cant Pause is not supposed to be an example of fine journalism. It’s supposed to be a sometimes casual, sometimes deep, dive into the hobby I love.

# Who Runs This Site?

I do. My name is Joseph and I’m a Software Engineer currently living in Seattle. No surprise here, but I love video games just like the billions of other gamers out the.

More importantly, for the context of this website, I love getting into the nitty-gritty of the video games industry. I love to dissect the most exciting rumored projects, the thoughts behind certain gaming-related business decisions, and where the industry is headed as a whole.

That’s why this site exists. 

Because I have a ton of super-niche video game thoughts and not many people to discuss them with.

Instead of posting a picture of me here, I’m going to post a picture of my dog Flora because why not. Hopefully, people don’t skip the text and assume a dog runs this site.

# Let's Have a Discussion!

At the end of the day I just want to talk about video games. If you read an opinion you like (or dislike) go ahead and tweet me about it so we can talk! I eventually want to implement a comment system but until then let's exchange DMs. [Here's a link to  my Twitter.](https://twitter.com/th3hoopman)
