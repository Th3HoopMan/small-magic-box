As we voyage into a new generation of video games there’s no doubt people are waiting to see what games will be the poster children (I’ve literally never heard poster child used in the plural sense but I’m going for it) of the next decade. In the past we’ve had franchises like Half Life, Halo, Skyrim, The Last of Us, and Grand Theft Auto show us what the pinnacle of gaming can look like. Games like these went above and beyond the industry standard. They provided detail, scale, polish, and interactivity that many of us didn’t even know was possible. The thing is, once we know it’s possible, it’s not as impressive. So for the next best thing to feel like the next best thing you need to up the ante, but at what cost?

## Taking a Look at the Timelines

Like I’m sure everyone might say, I believe I grew up in the golden years of gaming. To support my argument let me drop just a fraction of the best games (and the studios that made them) that released when I first started seriously getting into (AAA) gaming.

* Halo 2 - 2004 - Bungie
* Halo 3 - 2007 - Bungie
* Halo ODST - 2009 - Bungie
* Halo Reach - 2010 - Bungie
* Destiny - 2014 - Bungie
* Oblivion - 2006 - Bethesda
* Fallout 3 - 2008 - Bethesda
* Skyrim - 2011 - Bethesda
* Fallout 4 - 2015 - Bethesda
* Uncharted 1 - 2007 - Naughty Dog
* Uncharted 2 - 2009 - Naughty Dog
* Uncharted 3 - 2011 - Naughty Dog
* The Last of Us - 2013 - Naughty Dog
* GTA San Andreas - 2004 - Rockstar
* Bully - 2006 - Rockstar
* GTA 4 - 2008 - Rockstar
* Red Dead Redemption - 2010 - Rockstar
* GTA 5 - 2013 - Rockstar
* Mass Effect 1 - 2007 - Bioware
* Dragon Age - 2009 - Bioware
* Mass Effect 2 - 2010 - Bioware
* Dragon Age 2 - 2011 - Bioware
* Mass Effect 3 - 2012 - Bioware
* Dragon Age Inquisition - 2014 - Bioware
* Witcher 2 - 2011 - CD Projekt Red
* Witcher 3 - 2015 - CD Projekt Red

**Bungie** - **5 Quality Games** in a **10 Year Span**

**Bethesda** - **5 Quality Games** in a **11 Year Span**

**Naughty Dog** - **4 Quality Games** in a **6 Year Span**

**Rockstar** -  **5 Quality Games** in a **11 Year Span**

**Bioware** - **5 Quality Games** in a **7 Year Span**

**CD Projekt Red** - **2 Quality Games** in a **4 Year Span**

Am I crazy or were we getting banger AAA installments year after year? We got the entire Mass Effect Trilogy in five years. We got Skyrim and Fallout 3 just three years apart. I really hope I’m getting across how insane that is.

Now let’s take a look at what some of the same studios have done recently. These companies have only grown larger. The technology and tools have only gotten better. So that means logically we must be getting the same if not more amount of breath-taking adventures from these iconic studios right...right??

*Note*: Bungie has been in the unique situation of launching and managing an MMO so I’ll exclude them from the conversation and focus on studios that are primarily working on single-player focused games.

* **Bethesda Studios** (Todd Howard’s team specifically) has released **ONE** new game since the launch of Fallout 4 in 2015. That game was the MMO Fallout 76 which was released in 2018. That game was by far the worst release in the studio’s history. Their long-awaited space-themed single-player game Starfield is set to launch in November of 2022, making that a **7 year gap** between single-player titles.
* **Rockstar** has released **ONE** new game since GTA V in 2013. They released Red Dead Redemption 2 in 2018, a **7 year gap** between new titles.
* **Bioware** has released **TWO** new **games since their big 2014 hit, Dragon Age Inquisition. Mass Effect Andromeda dropped in 2017 and Anthem in 2019,** **both of which were spectacular flops for the developer**.
* **CD Projekt Red** has released **ONE** game since their (inserting bias here) masterpiece that was The Witcher 3. Cyberpunk 2077 dropped **5 years later** at the tail end of 2020 and was **arguably the worst AAA game launch in the past 15 years**.
* **Naughty Dog** has released **THREE** new games since the critical darling The Last of Us. Uncharted 4 dropped in 2016, Uncharted Lost Legacy dropped in 2017, and The Last of Us 2 dropped in 2020. **Naughty Dog is the only studio on this list that has been able to consistently maintain their game output without catastrophic dips in qualit**y.

## **The AAA Plague**

Many of the studios discussed above could be considered the grandfathers of modern gaming. Year after year they came back with games that exceeded expectations and set new standards for their respective genres.

So why is it that in the last decade many of them have had their game output slow down to a snail's pace, or even worst, seen their recent projects not only underperform but face unprecedented fan backlash?

### Ambition and Size

To start, I think we’ve gotten to the point where every installment of a AAA game is striving to be way too ambitious. Remember when I talked about a game “feeling like the next best thing”? It seems like some AAA studios believe the only way to achieve that is by making a game 2-3 times bigger and more detailed than the last. Marketing teams seem to be salivating at the mouth to tell us how many hundreds of hours of content are in the game, how the game map is bigger than the state of Texas, or how horse genitals will now shrink and expand with the weather. 

Sure, these things can be cool, but is it really worth it?

I’m not always looking for every big developer to release a larger-than-life epic in one single game. I don’t need a game to address everything I’ve ever dreamed of (and some things I never even imagined) in a cyberpunk dystopia or an old western. 

I don’t want to come off like I’m unappreciative of these once-in-a-generation, super ambitious projects, but when these games bring studio output down from roughly 5 games a decade to one it’s both concerning and a bit disappointing. 

Imagine going to your favorite restaurant once a month, and one day they add one of the top 10 best meals you’ve ever had to the menu. Sounds great right? Well right after you finish that meal they tell you to continue to serve it they’re going to remove every other item on the menu and they can now only afford to open once every two years, oh and there’s no guarantee that it’ll taste as good as this time. Not sure that’s the best analogy but that’s what I feel is happening to a lot of the veteran AAA gaming studios now.

### Creative Sparks

Take a second look at the timeline a posted. Do you notice anything interesting?

Yeah. There are *a lot* of sequels.

That’s because when you have a story and design that has already proven it can capture gamers’ attention your job becomes a lot easier. The world, characters, and gameplay mechanics already have a foundation that can be built upon. 

The problem is a lot of those franchises we reminisce on have happily concluded and their creators have had to go back to the drawing board. As we’ve seen with Bioware and CD Projekt Red, it’s not easy to make a compelling and unique story that pairs well with innovative and dynamic gameplay. 

It also doesn’t help that a lot of the top talent responsible for building up these illustrious studios have left to build their own legacies in the form of new companies.

When a new IP really works, it’s almost like catching a golden snitch. It leaves players craving more and it often establishes a blueprint for a studio’s next 10 years worth of projects. 

But until that golden IP is found it’s almost as if we’re all looking at a doomsday clock, wondering if these teams have enough time, talent, and funding to make the same magic that they have in the past.

### Money

AAA games are called AAA because of their massive budgets. They are the blockbuster movies of the games industry. They require both an insane amount of effort and money to get made, which is why there are only a few that get made each year. 

Remember when I talked about how ambitious some of these games are becoming? Well, that ambition comes with a price tag. Often a **multi-million dollar** price tag. And that price tag doesn’t remain constant, it grows. 

To meet those ambitious goals developers need a surplus of time, often more than they originally budgeted for. So now these projects are over-budget and way off schedule. That means the pressure is on. The budget isn’t infinite, but the game needs to be perfect if they want to make that money back right? The game has to fulfill the promises it made when it was revealed, but it turns out those things are way harder to implement in a game than they thought. I can only imagine how vicious the cycle can become.

Let’s say we’ve finally made it to the finish line. The 7-year, multi-million dollar project is finally out the door. What happens when if that project flops? Now there’s no funding for the next project. The publisher needs to make that money back somehow right? So nowadays it seems the answer is to chase the live service game. Something that can keep the money printing while the studios work on what they really want to.

As the video game industry grows, ironically we’re at the point where fewer and fewer studios have the financial support to take risks on interesting AAA projects. These projects are too expensive and often have no way to generate revenue beyond the initial game sale. So they get passed up in favor of an online game that can easily serve microtransactions.

## The Answer

So what is the fix? How can our favorite studios make more games with a consistent level of quality like back in the old days?

While I don’t think there is a magic bullet that solves all of the struggles of the AAA conundrum, I do think there’s a solution. I’m not in the video game industry and at the end of the day I’m just observing the little bit of inside baseball that I can find, but there is clear proof in the industry that there is an answer to this problem. While it seems like all of the big publishers are having identity crises looking for the next big thing, one lone company has stood tall.

**Playstation Studios.**

### Playstation Studios has Perfected the Formula

Throughout the PS4 generation, Playstation rose to dominance in the single-player action-adventure genre. They have seen success after success with an array of studios. They have done so well that **Insomniac Games** is seen as the gold standard in the industry right now, having released or announced:

* Spiderman - 2018
* Spiderman: Miles Morales - 2020
* Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart - 2021
* Spiderman 2 - Announced
* Wolverine - Announced

This is the quality and output I’m talking about. All three of Insomniac’s projects released in the past 4 years have been met with high praise, and fans can’t wait for what they’re cooking next. 

So how has Playstation been able to build this unrivaled stable of both old and new IPs across countless studios? What’s their secret formula?

### Reducing Scope

The reason studios like Insomniac and Naughty Dog are able to pump out titles so fast is because they aren’t afraid to release a contained experience. They look at the IPs and technology they have at their disposal and they put them to good use. 

Playstation is the only AAA publisher letting their studios consistently put out smaller bite-sized projects. For example, take a look at Uncharted: Lost Legacy, Infamous Second Son, Spiderman Miles Morales, and Astro’s Playroom. These games were all much smaller than their predecessors and built on existing engines and mechanics, but they were fantastic nonetheless.

Games like Ghost of Tsushima, God of War, Bloodborne, and Horizon Forbidden West are big, but they’re not trying to be a dozen different things in one. They provide just enough gameplay and story telling mechanisms to hook the player, and nothing more.

## Stick To Your Roots

I hate for this to be a shut up and dribble situation, but a lot of these studios should continue to have a foot planted where they started. Every game doesn’t need to have a sprawling open world. Every game doesn’t need to be online. Every game doesn’t need to be a live service. Sometimes people just want a good story and a fun mechanic. 

That’s not to say studios shouldn’t innovate, but there’s a reason those developers were so beloved back in the day, and there’s a reason Playstation has been seeing repeated success. It’s because well-crafted narratives and experiences resonate with people. For my sports fans out there, it’s why Seahawks fans were so pissed when their team threw the ball at the - yard line with the Superbowl on the line after they had successfully run the ball up to that point. Don’t fix what’s not broken. Continue to reward supporters by giving them experiences similar to what brought them to you in the first place.

### Changing of the Guard

![Respawn Entertainment Logo](/img/respawn-entertainment-black-logo-1200x675.jpg "Respawn Entertainment Logo")

We’ve already seen Playstation champion these ideas for over a decade, but it’s time for other publishers to step up and start also funding these types of projects. It’s not about always hitting the billion-dollar GTA V home run, sometimes it’s about building a solid swathe of series to choose from. Let’s get more Bioshocks, more Fables, more Sly Coopers.

It does seem like there are studios that starting to become the new gold standard. I’ve already mentioned Insomniac and Naughty Dog but there’s also:

* Arcane
* Respawn
* Sucker Punch
* Obsidian
* FromSoftware
* Playground Games
* The Coalition

And many more that I’ve left out. Hopefully, after teams are able to get their tools and engines ramped up for the newest generation of hardware we’ll start to see what they have been cooking for us.

## Settling Back Into Place

I don’t think it’s over for the studios I touched on at the beginning of this article. I just think they and their publishers needed a bit of time to do some soul searching. Luckily, it seems like a lot of publishers are coming back around to support a lot of the teams and franchises that we’ve come to know and love over the past couple of decades.

With Microsoft’s gargantuan investment in gaming studios, I hope their game output ramps up and becomes a AAA powerhouse alongside Playstation. 

EA hit a home run with Hazelight, and they seem to be trying to get Bioware and their other studios back on track and making titles that people have been asking for.

Ubisoft...is still making Ubisoft games.

Take Two looks like they have no incentive to move with a purpose as long as GTA Online is printing money, but maybe we’ll get a new Bioshock announcement someday.

Only time will tell if the AAA industry will shift back to the single-player juggernaut that it once was, but I am hopeful.

## Side Note: About Nintendo, AA Games, and Others

I wanted to focus this article on the few AAA studios that were leading the industry when I was growing up. I know the AAA space is much larger than the big RPG and single-player that I covered. Many publishers like Epic and Activision have seen success with their free-to-play multiplayer behemoths, and Ubisoft has held strong with their big open-world experiences. I think of all that can be their own discussions.

As for the others...

Nintendo marches to the beat of their own drum so they’re almost irrelevant in this conversation. Although I do think they’ve had some interesting years as of late.

AA games seemed to have died out for a while, but it looks like they’re coming back with titles like It Takes Two receiving heaps of praise. 

Indies honestly seem stronger than ever. Consistently forcing their way into the game of the year conversation with titles like Hades and Inscryption. 

We’ll talk about all of it in due time.
