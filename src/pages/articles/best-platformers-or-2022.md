For the past several weeks, I've been trying to find the best indie games in as many genres as I can, and I'm in the process of compiling lists and publishing the run downs on my Youtube channel. A couple of weeks ago I released my list of best platformers of 2022. Came as a bit of a surprise to me that good indie platformers are a bit few and far between these days unfortunately. That being said I was still able to put together a pretty solid list.
