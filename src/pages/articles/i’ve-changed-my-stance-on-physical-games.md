Over the past couple years I have convinced myself that digital games are the future and we need to speed up our transition to an all digital gaming landscape as soon as possible. I mean, it’s 2022, we need to unshackle ourselves from the chains of physical media right? Well, maybe not exactly. I’ve had a change of heart. Physical games are not just awesome, they’re necessary. 

Let’s start this off by saying I haven’t completely turned my back on digital games. Any game I buy day one will almost always be bought digitally from here on out. It all comes back to that magic C word, the one people actually like, convenience. Having the ability to download a game to my console in under 15 minutes, removing the need to get up to change discs, being able to swap games at the drop of a hat, eliminating clutter and hoarding of game cases, these things can’t be understated. I love it. It is truly (no pun intended) a game changer.

That being said, this town is actually big enough for the both of us. Us being digital physical games. The convenience of digital games is nice, but the real argument for physical games comes down to ownership and game preservation. While some publishers like Xbox have championed game preservation and worked hard to make legacy games available on modern hardware, publishers like Nintendo have not. Nintendo recently announced they were shutting down their [3DS and Wii U eshops](https://www.fanbyte.com/news/nintendo-eshop-3ds-wii-u-shutdown/) and I can’t but help to feel a nasty about the entire situation. I completely skipped that era of Nintendo and it will now be extremely hard for myself and others to go back and experience it. Sadly, this will only become more and more common. As companies begin to see that the cost of keeping certain stores and services running outweighs the profit, they will begin shutting them down, effectively wiping out huge chunks of gaming history.

I’ll admit, I am not a retro gamer. I rarely have a desire to go back and play old games, but that’s not the point. I’m a fan of video game history, and right now it looks like that history will be viewed through a sliding window. As we go further into the future, we lose visibility of more  of the past. To combat this, we need both physical games and digital archives of older games that can no longer be purchased. 

I hope two decades from now I have the opportunity to relive this current era of video games. I hope there’s ways to allow future generations to experience what we have the pleasure of experiencing now. I hope there will always be physical copies of the most iconic and niche games that we can preserve and showcase exhaustive game collections.
