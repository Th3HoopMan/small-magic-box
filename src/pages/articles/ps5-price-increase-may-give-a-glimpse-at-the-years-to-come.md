Big news from PlayStation as we hear they plan to raise the price of the PS5 in every market except the US. I don't think this is devastating news by any means, the PS5 is already a premium product and this will not change that. The PS5 will continue to sell out for the forseeable future, especially as we see titles like God of War Ragnarok and Final Fantasy 16 lined up to drop.

What is more interesting is how this will affect the industry in months and years to come, I have some theories. Check out the video I put together below.
