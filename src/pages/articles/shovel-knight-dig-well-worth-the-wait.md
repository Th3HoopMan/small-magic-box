I'm trying something new this time around.

T﻿his is a series of firsts so I'm going to need some support here:

* F﻿irst ever impressions coverage
* F﻿irst ever fully edited video for the channel
* F﻿irst ever game provided by a publisher for coverage



B﻿elow is a video capturing my initial thoughts on a game I've been waiting on for a long time, Shovel Knight Dig. Like I say in the video, I haven't beaten it yet so these are not my final thoughts, those should come in a later written article. Even so, I have played quite a number of hours at this point and I have had a blast the entire time. I'll let the video speak for itself, but here are a couple of brief notes that I didn't mention in the video.


I﻿ played almost all of the game on my Steam Deck so far and it has performed flawlessly. It feels incredible as a handheld title and I would strongly suggest playing it that way. Unfortunately, I can't speak to the performance on the Switch, so check out trusted reviewers for insight before buying it there.

T﻿he game is on the shorter side in terms of content it seems. From what I can tell there are maybe 5 or 6 total areas that you can come across during a run. That's not super untraditional for a roguelite like this, just don't go in expecting hours upon hours of evolving content.

I﻿f you have any questions about the game that you want to see in the final review, leave a comment on the video below or email me using the contact in the footer at the bottom of the page. Enjoy!
