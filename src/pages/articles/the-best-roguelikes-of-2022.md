I feel like roguelikes are games in a genre that have recently blown up due to the success of titles like Dead Cells and Hades. I know for me personally, I hadn't delved into the genre much before those breakout titles. It seems now the genre is more normalized and approachable than ever, so it didn't surprise me to see some of the biggest games this year on the list.
