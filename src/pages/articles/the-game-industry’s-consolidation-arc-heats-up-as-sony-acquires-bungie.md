So Bungie has been acquired...again. This time Sony has wined and dined the acclaimed studio and as a result, has officially brought them into the PlayStation family for a whopping 3.6 billion dollars.

I can’t lie, I was completely caught off guard by this news. Not only because the Halo creators have been historically associated with Xbox, but because it’s not entirely clear what the (no pun intended) play by PlayStation is here. Let’s dive into it.

## PlayStation’s Modus Operandi

For forever now PlayStation has been known to dominate with in two specific categories: exclusives and homegrown studios. 

This acquisition seems to be a departure from both.

We’ve seen this story time and time again: 

* PlayStation partners with a studio to create a console-exclusive title for their platform.
* That title does numbers and the studio becomes synonymous with PlayStation.
* PlayStation acquires said studio, effectively putting a ring on a already exclusive relationship.

Bungie almost seems like the complete opposite:

* Bungie has historic ties to the Xbox platform
* Destiny has always been a multi-platform game that I’m not sure many people associate with PlayStation
* Bungie has stated that they will [continue to be a multi-platform studio even after the acquisition](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2022-01-31-playstation-bungie-will-considerably-accelerate-our-journey-with-multiplatform-live-service-games)

PlayStation runs a clandestine operation. We rarely get accurate reports about what they’re planning or what people are thinking on the inside. We usually have such little bits of information to go off of when speculating on what the future holds the gaming giant. This acquisition is about as big as a signal we could get that there will big shift in how PlayStation plans to approach the games market going forward.

## Finally Ready to Break Down Barriers

PlayStation has become the industry leader by building the most desirable and exclusive kingdom in all the lands. For a long time, to experience all of its glory and see what was beyond the kingdom’s walls you would have no choice but to pay the price of entry.

For awhile now, it has seemed like the walls of the kingdom were getting shorter. To the point where today you can just barely see what wonders lie inside. With this acquisition it seems like the walls may be coming down faster than we thought.

Medieval analogy aside, PlayStation seems like they’re finally ready to embrace the idea of multi-platform experiences. They have started to build a strong cadence of first-party PC releases, they have invested in a studio that specializes in PC ports, and they have now acquired the creators of one of the biggest live-service multi-platform games out right now.

While I don’t think PlayStation games will have a future on other consoles, it does seem like we’re fast-approaching a future where PC players may be getting them at the same time as PlayStation players.

## Filling in the Gaps

While PlayStation has risen on it’s extraordinary ability to create single-player narrative driven games, they have realized that for true growth they will need to expand their wheelhouse. 

With the recent acquisitions of Bethesda and Activision/Blizzard, Microsoft has cornered both the FPS market with the industry’s biggest titles like Halo, Call of Duty, Gears, Overwatch, and Doom, as well as the western RPG market with celebrated franchises like Fable, Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and Outwerworlds.

For a long-time fans have looked past PlayStation’s lack of presence in these spaces, but with the threat of many historically multi-platform titles soon being made exclusive, it’s unclear if fans will be pulled elsewhere to enjoy these experiences. 

It seems like the folks at PlayStation recognize this and are investing to make sure they can compete beyond the single-player genre. Jim Ryan and friends are eying the live service space, and they expect teams like the ones at Bungie to help them push their way in.

It’s too early to tell what this will look like, but it’s safe to say PlayStation has an uphill battle ahead of them. Their track-record with [FPS](https://gamerant.com/killzone-shadow-fall-multiplayer-activity-hackers-player-count-2022/) and [multiplayer experiences](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/destruction-allstars-gets-substantial-changes-may-be-going-free-to-play/) speaks for itself, but if they want to change the narrative here I think they’re assembling the right talent to help with that.

## Destiny Movie Coming in Hot

The other angle here is Destiny film and TV adaptions. Sony obviously has big flag planted in Hollywood, so it would make sense that they could be looking to make a bigger effort to intertwine their highly successful gaming business with the reach of their film and TV productions.

![Destiny Live Action](/img/liveaction.png "Destiny Live Action")

They have already cashed in on their ownership of Spiderman twelve-times over, and they’re currently trying to do the same with [The Last of Us](https://www.gamesradar.com/last-of-us-tv-show-seemingly-confirmed-for-2022-release-date/) and [Uncharted](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-uncharted-movie-poster-released-as-tickets-go-on-sale/1100-6500104/). It’s unclear if all of their IP will see the same levels of success that they already have in video games, but Sony is definitely committed to the vision. 

I’m less as excited on this front. We’ve had stellar adaptions like The Witcher and Arcane be released over that past couple years, but I’m skeptical if other productions will capture the same magic. We’ll find out soon enough with Halo, Uncharted, Cuphead, and The Last of Us all scheduled to be dropping their film adaptations this year.

## Bungie’s Perspective

I think Bungie got themselves a great deal. In another post I spoke about [how difficult it was to create AAA games,](https://cantpause.com/articles/aaa-games-are-being-crushed-by-their-own-size-and-ambition/) and now they have the safety of PlayStation to do so without fear. 

They also seem to be maintaining complete autonomy. They will be able to self publish and release on whatever platforms they see fit. To me this deal seems like a no-brainer. 

This deal allows them to hire more talent and take risks on new projects. I honestly think this acquisition is great for everyone involved, including the players.

## At This Point Its Just Galactus Masked as Gaming Companies

In the past couple years the big players in the industry have been making a made dash to swallow up as many studios as publishers as they can afford. Within the past 5 years Microsoft, Tencent, PlayStation, TakeTwo, and Embracer Group have acquired an insane amount of studios.

Recently, all eyes have been on Microsoft as they’ve made two of the biggest acquisitions in gaming history (Bethesda and Activision/King/Blizzard) in an effort to build out their unstoppable juggernaut that is GamePass. 

Many have wondered, how will PlayStation respond? Well, we finally have our answer...kinda. 

This is not a direct response to the Activision/Blizzard. Jim Ryan said himself that this deal has been in the works for over a year. This is more of a response to the industry trend as a whole. 

This may have not have been the move that many PlayStation fans have wanted. Cries for the acquisition of Square Enix, or Sega, or Konami have echoed across Twitter for the past couple weeks. Regardless, it clearly made sense to the PlayStation leadership. 

That’s not to say that the acquisitions are done. I think PlayStation still has more work to do if they want to compete with money being spent by other publishers. Whether that’s good or bad is a discussion for another time. Companies have money to be spent, US dollars are rapidly losing their value, and every week the fear of losing out on a majority third-party looms over the heads of these gaming execs.
